Roadmap
=======

- Switch :code:`$HOME/.dsco/settings.json` to a :code:`toml` file. 
  This will allow me to add comments, which should make it much 
  easier to use.
- Figure out where in the code to automatically create the :code:`settings`
  file.
- Figure out how to allow for custom project templates.
- Add tools to (re)run and manage sphinx-apidoc
